    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the ReversingLabs SDK to search and analyze samples using the `AdvancedSearch` and `AdvancedActions` classes. \n",
    "The Advanced Search enables users to filter samples by search criteria submitted in a query string. The script focuses on specific URI and/or file type, wide range of search keywords is available, and they can be combined using search operators to build advanced queries.\n",
    "Advanced Actions is a class containing advanced and combined actions utilizing various different classes such as Static analysis (TCA-0104) and Dynamic analysis (TCA-0106). \n",
    "Combined together, client can have a comprehensive enriched report, providing single URL, File type or any other supported filter value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a similar implementation reference, see the [ReversingLabs SDK Cookbook - Spectra Intelligence Search Notebook](https://alt-gitlab.rl.lan/integrations/sdk/reversinglabs-sdk-cookbook/-/blob/main/Spectra Intelligence/search.ipynb?ref_type=heads)."
