    "### Threat Hunting Workflow\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the RL SDK python package to look for samples which match our YARA rule reaching as far back as possible.\n",
    "To do this we will have to build a pipeline which will employ various TiCloud APIs.\n",
    "The complete pipeline is show on the following diagram.\n",
    "Each of the elements in the diagram is explained in detail in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](images/pipeline.png \"Pipeline diagram\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of three distinct stages: A, B and C.\n",
    "The first stage is the setup stage in which we will create our rule on TiCloud and start a Retro Hunt for that rule.\n",
    "Stage B handles processing of samples retrieved using the Advanced Search API.\n",
    "This API is the keystone of our efforts to extend the YARA hunt beyond the reach of a YARA Retro Hunt (90 days).\n",
    "Stage C collects matches from both YARA Retro Hunt feed and regular YARA feed.\n",
    "These matches are then enriched with the static and dynamic reports (if those exist) and stored to local storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline has multiple parameters which you may tweak to modify its behaviour.\n",
    "The first two parameters are of course the YARA rule and the Advanced Search query.\n",
    "These will, of course, have the most impact on the collected samples.\n",
    "**NOTE** that you should use search parameters which closely match what the YARA rule is hunting for.\n",
    "There are 4 limit parameters as well.\n",
    "Modifying or removing these limits will impact the performance of the pipeline.\n",
    "**NOTE** to remove a limit simply assign the value `None` to the constant, for example `SEARCH_LIMIT = None`.\n",
    "The primary intention of these limits is to allow users to reduce the number of samples which this pipeline produces.\n",
    "TiCloud has a large number of samples, it may be impractical to pull a lot of reports onto a machine you which you are running this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** that this pipeline is kept as simple as possible. There is minimal error handling.\n",
    "We do not employ asynchronous, multithreading or prefetching techniques, any of which may be used to improve the performance of the pipeline.\n",
    "Any sample reports we pull are stored on local storage.\n",
    "The purpose of this pipeline is first and foremost to illustrate how you could enhance your usage of TiCloud APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better explain what we are doing we will use the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](images/timeline.png \"Timeline\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When a YARA ruleset is created any sample analyzed by TiCloud is matched against it.\n",
    "If the sample matches the ruleset it will be present in the YARA matches feed.\n",
    "We can at any time start a YARA Retro Hunt to try and match any sample which was uploaded to TiCloud in the last 90 days.\n",
    "But if wish to hunt for samples which might match our YARA ruleset and have not appeared on TiCloud in the last 90 days we will have to do a little bit of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Advanced Search API allows us to search for samples by any number of parameters.\n",
    "The two most important ones are **firstseen** and **lastseen**.\n",
    "If we create a ruleset and immediately start a Retro Hunt we can take a timestamp and calculate these values.\n",
    "In this notebook we will only look a year into the past, but you may wish to go event further back.\n",
    "The red part of the timeline is limited by the **firstseen** and **lastseen** parameters of the search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take the search results which fall under this timeframe and submit them for reanalysis.\n",
    "Since we created a YARA ruleset before doing so these old samples will be matched against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blue segment on the timeline represents the timeframe covered by the YARA Retro Hunt.\n",
    "The green part of the timeline is the period in which we run the pipeline to consume the Retro Hunt and regular YARA feeds."
